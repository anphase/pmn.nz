The amount of hard work mixed with strokes of luck in these types of books/stories always fascinating to me."

  goodreads: "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41571759-conscious"
  thoughts: "One interesting insight from the book is that we don't seem to consciously choose to do something. Some other processes, experience, the environment, circumstances etc. decide what we do but we get a sense of agency about what we've done. We have the illusion that we are in control and yet the reality we perceive is an edited version of the recent past - our brain processes are in a constant state of editing to synchronise sounds and touch and sights into a coherent whole. Events unfold and we consciously witness them."

  thoughts: "I heard good things about this book and I was curious -- I don't actually have and I've never really had back pain. I enjoyed this book. The premise is that TMS (Tension Myoneural Syndrome) and psychological factors can cause back pain - not just injury. Additionally you can overcome this pain, sometimes instantaneously after years of pain just by understanding what it is. It seems to work based on what I've heard people say in random places -- I think there's something to it."
