This website doesn't have any tracking or analytics set up. I have no idea who's reading or where they are coming from. I think this is fine. 

By focusing on the process of documenting content and communicating ideas, I get better at it and I'm intrinsically motivated to do more of it. I've gained, and continue to gain, a lot of value from the work that other people have put out there and I feel obligated to make some kind of contribution.

I recently finished reading the book [Ultra-learning][1] and it ties in brilliantly with my commitment to being a life long learner - I am definelty applying some of the techniques in there. I think in this time, it's very important to get good at whatever it is you do, not just for your own sake but also to the benefit of others who are direclty or indirectly affected by your work.
