# Random Ramble

The systems in our bodies appear to be working together towards the same goals. When we perform a task or recall a memory, it appears as if all our parts are working in unison to get the task at hand completed. The reality however is that there is conflict at the cellular level - every cell is fighting to stay alive.

Attention tends towards activity in our brains, so our minds wander from thought to though throughout the day. Whenever we idle (i.e. when the [default mode network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network) is active, our minds come alive with all sorts of thoughts. If you try to think of nothing, it's almost like there's a pressure to shift to something, anything! 

When we meditate, we shift our attention against the stream of thought to focus on nothing or on something simple like our breathing. This allows all other thoughts and activities in out minds to mature and grow using our built-in unsupervised intelligence. When we consciously bring our attention to something that has not matured enough, this thought appears to get stunted. It's like by thinking about it we are freeing the thought from occupying our mind by highlighting weaknesses and flaws in our thinking. This essentially kills the idea/thought/vision/whatever entirely and we move on.

When we allow the unconscious mind to act on our thoughts - creativity emerges. Connections that don't make sense to the conscious mind are bridged. When An idea fails to latch on to anything in the unconscious, then there's nothing to latch on to in the conscious.  The unconscious mind takes everything seriously, there's no right or wrong, there are no emotions or past failures attached to it, no personality defects or distorted lenses - just pure thought.

## Parallelism

The mind is highly parallel. Millions of operations are happening at different levels in the brain at any moment. Blood flow, electrical activity and chemical changes are happening all the time affecting small and large regions in the brain. Only a small part of this activity is brought to our conscious attention. In fact, it's easy to see in this light that most of what happens in the brain is not what we perceive, but what we don't perceive. What we perceive is only the tip of the iceberg. 

The brain is the most complex *thing* we know in the universe. That's not saying much because we don't know much compared to what we believe there is to know of course, but we know quite a lot.

So meditate and allow yourself to grow.
