# Just testing Jekyll: Ramble

Our minds and bodies appear to be working together towards singular coherent goals. When we perform a task, recall a memory or just go through our day, it appears as if every part of our body is working in unison. The reality however is that there is conflict at the cellular level. Every cell in our bodies and our minds is fighting to stay alive.

**Attention tends towards activity** in our minds, so our minds wander from thought to though throughout the day. Whenever we idle, our minds come alive with all sorts of thoughts and fantasies. If you try to think of nothing, it's almost like there's a pressure to shift to something, anything! 

When we meditate, we shift our attention against the stream of thought to focus on nothing. This allows all other thoughts and activities in out minds to mature and grow using our built-in unsupervised intelligence. When we consciously bring our attention to a though that has not matured enough, this thought appears to get stunted because of too many cooks. Weaknesses are exposed and unique connections never get made. This essentially kills the idea/thought/vision/whatever entirely and we move on.

When we allow the unconscious mind to act on our thoughts - creativity emerges. Connections that don't make sense to the conscious mind are bridged. When An idea fails to latch on to anything in the unconscious, then there's nothing to latch on to in the conscious.  The unconscious mind takes everything seriously, there's no right or wrong, there are no emotions or past failures attached to it, no personality defects or distorted lenses - just pure thought.

## Parallelism

The mind is highly parallel. Millions of operations are happening at different levels in the brain at any moment. Blood flow, electrical activity and chemical changes are happening all the time affecting small and large regions in the brain. Only a small part of this activity is brought to our conscious attention. In fact, it's easy to see in this light that most of what happens in the brain is not what we perceive, but what we don't perceive. What we perceive is only the tip of the iceberg. 

The brain is the most complex *thing* we know in the universe. That's not saying much because we don't know much compared to what we believe there is to know of course, but we know quite a lot.

So meditate and allow yourself to grow.
