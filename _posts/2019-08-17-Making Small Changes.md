I've just finished reading James Clear's book, [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits), and I found it quite [brilliant](../books/#Atomic_Habits "thoughts on Atomic Habits").
One of the biggest lessons from the book is the power of making small changes and how they compound over time - it's articulated beautifully in the book. I'm paraphrasing here:
> you get what you repeat -- time will magnify it

I love this idea and it's one more thing I'm going to be more deliberate about in my work flow.

I wrote so many notes on this book, it almost felt like I was quoting every sentence! No matter, I will go through the notes and post my full review on [Saccader](https://saccader.com).
