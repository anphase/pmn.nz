Although focusing on successes is great and all, I want to make a little space for some of my failed endeavours. So to some extent, this is like a project graveyard. I will describe what I was trying to build based on notes, code and or other efforts that I documented.

**When:** 2014-2015

**What:** A notes app with superpowers.

**Points:**
- I didn't like the landscape of notes apps as far as information organisation. 
- I wanted to create an app that slowly gets to know me (Self-I-Me...), automatically arganises information based on hashtags or something. 
- I wanted to create an app that uses hash tags (or something) trigger events. Say for instance, I'm writing this post and I want to post it to my WordPress blog. What if all I needed to do to accomplish that is just type ```#wordpress(@'Anphase Blog')``` and boom! This very text goes to the [Anphase Blog](https://anphase.com).

Come to think of it, [Reddit](https://reddit.com) bots kinda do something like that. Typing something like "RemindMe! in 24hrs" triggers a bot that will remind the commenter of the thread. We don't really see powerful actions in notes apps beyond calendar actions and tagging.

**Why did it fail:** I never made any progress on it beyond registering the domain SelfIMe.com only to let it expire when I realised it had nothing to do with the ideas I was building around it.

**Future:** I think there are some interesting ideas I can salvage from this. Maybe I'll pick it up some day - there's always room for yet another notes app.

**When:** 2017-2018

**What:** A bicycle for the mind

**Points:**
- I wanted to organise my book reviews and things I was learning
- To accomplish this I wanted to create a syntax for writing/recording information in such a way that it could be digested intelligently. For instance, in writing my notes I could write notes with questions and answers such as:
```.env
{*html}
{q}
	What does WAI-ARIA stand for?
{a}
	Web Accessibility Initiative Accessible Rich Internet Applications
{/a}
```
These notes can then be presented as a question and answer in Anki cards or something
