  <p>I enjoy reading other people’s book lists so I’m writing my own – hopefully someone finds it interesting. I rate the books out of 5 and add an asterisk * to books that stood out to me. I’ve also written a blurb with my thoughts or some takeaways where I can. I generally read non-fiction books on a variety of topics from art to science and engineering, but I do dabble in fiction here and there.</p>

<p>— by James Clear</p>

<p><em>Thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>this is one of the best books on productivity that I’ve come across.</li>
  <li>the idea is that small improvements everyday compound to make  massive changes</li>
  <li>this works both ways, for good and bad habits so it’s important to learn to build good habits and squash bad ones</li>

<p>– by John Brockman</p>

<p><em>Thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s a bit of a mixed bag - some of the essays brilliant and others are not so much</li>
  <li>I liked the one by Stephen Wolfram</li>
  <li>Interesting read though, I dropped my jaw a few times</li>

<h4 id="The_Accidental_Mind"><em>The Accidental Mind: How Brain Evolution Has Given Us Love, Memory, Dreams, and God</em></h4>

<p>– by David J. Linden</p>

<p><em>Thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>What an eye opener!</li>
  <li>The premise of the book is that the brain is not designed well at all - it’s a kludge</li>
  <li>Interesting ideas about about the why there’s religion across all human cultures and other things</li>
  <li>I love it when authors go out on a limb with some wild ideas</li>

<h4 id="Understanding_the_Brain"><em>Understanding the Brain: From Cells to Behaviour to Cognition</em></h4>

<p>— by John E. Downling</p>

<p><em>Thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>The way the brain works is very different from the way artificial neural networks work.</li>
  <li>Brain function is way more nuanced and complex.</li>
  <li>I love books like this that touch on a topic that we understand a lot about but also know less than there is to know about.</li>
  <li>There are lots of:
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>we don’t fully understand why …<br /></li>
        <li>the [function/mechanism] of [this processes/thing] is not yet known …</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Great intro to neuroscience</li>

  <li>Packed with practical advice about learning</li>
  <li>The 9 Principles of ultra-learning: meta learning, focus, directness, drill, retrieval, feedback, retention, intuition, experimentation</li>
  <li>Will need to revisit this, makes a lot of sense and is backed up by some compelling data</li>

<h4 id="Deep_Work"><em>Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World</em></h4>

<p>– by Cal Newport</p>

<p><em>Thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>I resonate with the call for more deep work and less shallow work</li>
  <li>There are a few conflicting and not-so-clear points, gets a wee bit rambly</li>

<h4 id="Kinds_of_Minds"><em>Kinds Of Minds: Toward An Understanding Of Consciousness</em></h4>

<p>– by Daniel C. Dennett</p>

<p><em>Thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Short but thought-provoking read on what consciousness may be in other minds</li>
  <li>What makes a mind powerful/conscious is not what it’s made of or how big it is, but what it can do</li>
  <li>Manipulating and considering our concepts is what separates human minds from everything else</li>

  <li>One of the key takeaways: a prepared mind wandering is <em>necessary</em> for creativity.</li>

<h4 id="The_Age_of_Insight"><em>The Age of Insight: The Quest to Understand the Unconscious in Art, Mind, and Brain from Vienna 1900 to the Present</em></h4>

<p>– by Eric R. Kandel</p>

<p><em>Thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.</li>
  <li>Basically, lots went down in the development of art, modern medicine and science in Vienna from 1900 - Einstein, painters/artists, psychology, Freud, Jung etc. to DNA.</li>

<p>– by Eric R. Kandel</p>

<p><em>Thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Reductionism in art 🖼 taps into mechanisms in the brain for interpreting reality, in colour, shapes, edges, faces etc.</li>
  <li>I’ve gained a deeper appreciation for reductionist art because of this book.</li>

<p>– by Joseph A. Annibali</p>

<p><em>Thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>I enjoyed reading this, it covers the mechanisms of the brain and how to manage oneself.</li>
  <li>One of the key takeaways: find what energises you/fills your spiritual well. Do it bit by bit and let it expand</li>

<h4 id="Conscious"><em>Conscious: A Brief Guide of the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind</em></h4>

<p>– by Annaka Harris</p>

<p><em>Thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>One interesting insight from the book is that we don’t seem to consciously choose to do something. Some other processes, experience, the environment, circumstances etc. decide what we do but we get a sense of agency about what we’ve done.</li>
  <li>We have the illusion that we are in control and yet the reality we perceive is an edited version of the recent past - our brain processes are in a constant state of editing to synchronise sounds and touch and sights into a coherent whole.</li>
  <li>Events unfold and we consciously witness them.</li>

<h4 id="When"><em>When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing</em></h4>

<p>– by Daniel H. Pink</p>

<p><em>Thoughts</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Eye opening read</li>
  <li>I had no idea we all have chronotypes that determine out ability to perform across the day - the difference between these times can be profound</li>
  <li>I love books like this that reveal or expand on things in plain sight</li>
