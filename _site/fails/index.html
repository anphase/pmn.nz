  <h1 class="page-title">Fails</h1>
  <p>Although focusing on successes is great and all, I want to make a little space for some of my failed endeavours. So to some extent, this is like a project graveyard. I will describe what I was trying to build based on notes, code and or other efforts that I documented.</p>

<h2 id="selfime">Selfime:</h2>
<p><strong>When:</strong> 2014-2015</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> A notes app with superpowers.</p>

<p><strong>Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I didn’t like the landscape of notes apps as far as information organisation.</li>
  <li>I wanted to create an app that slowly gets to know me (Self-I-Me…), automatically arganises information based on hashtags or something.</li>
  <li>I wanted to create an app that uses hash tags (or something) trigger events. Say for instance, I’m writing this post and I want to post it to my WordPress blog. What if all I needed to do to accomplish that is just type <code class="highlighter-rouge">#wordpress(@'Anphase Blog')</code> and boom! This very text goes to the <a href="https://anphase.com">Anphase Blog</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Come to think of it, <a href="https://reddit.com">Reddit</a> bots kinda do something like that. Typing something like “RemindMe! in 24hrs” triggers a bot that will remind the commenter of the thread. We don’t really see powerful actions in notes apps beyond calendar actions and tagging.</p>

<p><strong>Why did it fail:</strong> I never made any progress on it beyond registering the domain SelfIMe.com only to let it expire when I realised it had nothing to do with the ideas I was building around it.</p>

<p><strong>Future:</strong> I think there are some interesting ideas I can salvage from this. Maybe I’ll pick it up some day - there’s always room for yet another notes app.</p>

<h2 id="memorybike">Memory.bike</h2>
<p><strong>When:</strong> 2017-2018</p>

<p><strong>What:</strong> A bicycle for the mind</p>

<p><strong>Points:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I wanted to organise my book reviews and things I was learning</li>
  <li>To accomplish this I wanted to create a syntax for writing/recording information in such a way that it could be digested intelligently. For instance, in writing my notes I could write notes with questions and answers such as:
    <pre><code class="language-.env">{*html}
{q}
  What does WAI-ARIA stand for?
{a}
  Web Accessibility Initiative Accessible Rich Internet Applications
{/a}
</code></pre>
    <p>These notes can then be presented as a question and answer in Anki cards or something
(WIP… to be continued…ß)</p>
  </li>
</ul>
