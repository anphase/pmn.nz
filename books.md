I try to read books every now and again. I mainly read non-fiction books covering a wide range of topics that interest me. I will rate the books out of 5 and add an asterisk * to books that stood out to me and write a blurb where I can.

> I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.

_Thoughts so far_
* The way the brain works is very different from the way artificial neural networks work. 
* Brain function is way more nuanced and complex. 
* I love books like this that touch on a topic that we understand a lot about but also know less than there is to know about.
* There are lots of:

> * we don't fully understand why ...

> * the [function/mechanism] of [this processes/thing] is not yet known ...

#### _Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones_* 
{: #Atomic_Habits}

--- by James Clear
  
_Thoughts_
* this is one of the best books on productivity that I've come across.
* the idea is that small improvements everyday compound to make  massive changes
* this works both ways, for good and bad habits so it's important to learn to build good habits and squash bad ones

#### _Gene Machine: The Race to Decipher the Secrets of the Ribosome_

--- by Venki Ramakrishna
  
_Thoughts_
* interesting read about the author's journey to winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. 
* reminds me of Eric R. Kandel's book, In Search of Memory, which is also a story about that author's journey to a Nobel Prize. 
* the amount of hard work mixed with strokes of luck in these stories always fascinating to me.

_Rating_: 3.5/5
