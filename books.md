I enjoy reading other people's book lists so I'm writing my own -- hopefully someone finds it interesting. I rate the books out of 5 and add an asterisk * to books that stood out to me. I've also written a blurb with my thoughts or some takeaways where I can. I generally read non-fiction books on a variety of topics from art to science and engineering, but I do dabble in fiction here and there.

> * we don't fully understand why ...<br>
> * the [function/mechanism] of [this processes/thing] is not yet known ...
* Great intro to neuroscience

#### _Kinds Of Minds: Toward An Understanding Of Consciousness_
{: #Kinds_of_Minds}

#### _Conscious: A Brief Guide of the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind_
{: #Conscious}

-- by Annaka Harris

_Thoughts_
* One interesting insight from the book is that we donâ€™t seem to consciously choose to do something. Some other processes, experience, the environment, circumstances etc. decide what we do but we get a sense of agency about what weâ€™ve done. 
* We have the illusion that we are in control and yet the reality we perceive is an edited version of the recent past - our brain processes are in a constant state of editing to synchronise sounds and touch and sights into a coherent whole. 
* Events unfold and we consciously witness them.
* [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41571759-conscious)

_Rating_: 4/5

#### _When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing_
{: #When}

-- by Daniel H. Pink

* I love books like this that reveal or expand on things in plain sight
* [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35412097-when)

_Rating_: 5/5
