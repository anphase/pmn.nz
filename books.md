I try to read books every now and again. I mainly read non-fiction books covering a wide range of topics that interest me. I will add an * to books that stood out to me and write a blurb where I can.

* wow

#### _Gene Machine: The Race to Decipher the Secrets of the Ribosome_

--- by Venki Ramakrishna
  
_Thoughts_
* interesting read about the author's journey to winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. 
* reminds me of Eric R. Kandel's book, In Search of Memory, which is also a story about that author's journey to a Nobel Prize. 
* the amount of hard work and randomness in these stories is always fascinating to me.
