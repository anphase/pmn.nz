I enjoy reading other people's reading lists so I'm writing my own -- hopefully someone finds it interesting. I will rate the books out of 5 and add an asterisk * to books that stood out to me and write some pointers blurb where I can.

> I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.

#### _Atomic Habits: An Easy and Proven Way to Build Good Habits and Break Bad Ones_* 
{: #Atomic_Habits}

--- by James Clear
  
_Thoughts_
* this is one of the best books on productivity that I've come across.

#### _Gene Machine: The Race to Decipher the Secrets of the Ribosome_
{: #Gene_Machine}

--- by Venki Ramakrishna
  
_Thoughts_
* interesting read about the author's journey to winning the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. 
* reminds me of Eric R. Kandel's book, In Search of Memory, which is also a story about that author's journey to a Nobel Prize. 
* the amount of hard work mixed with strokes of luck in these stories always fascinating to me.

_Rating_: 4/5

_Rating_: 5/5

---

#### _Possible Minds: Twenty-Five Ways of Looking at AI_
{: #Possible_Minds}

* It's a bit of a mixed bag - some of the essays brilliant and others are not so much
* I liked the one by Stephen Wolfram
* Interesting read though

_Rating_: 3.5/5

---

#### _The Accidental Mind: How Brain Evolution Has Given Us Love, Memory, Dreams, and God_
{: #The_Accidental_Mind}

-- by David J. Linden

_Thoughts_
* What an eye opener!
* The premise of the book is that the brain is not designed well at all - it's a kludge
* Interesting ideas about about the why there's religion across all human cultures and other things
* I love it when authors go out on a limb with some wild ideas

_Rating_: 4.5/5

---

#### _Understanding the Brain: From Cells to Behaviour to Cognition_
{: #Understanding_the_Brain}

--- by John E. Downling

_Thoughts_
* The way the brain works is very different from the way artificial neural networks work. 
* Brain function is way more nuanced and complex. 
* I love books like this that touch on a topic that we understand a lot about but also know less than there is to know about.
* There are lots of:
> * we don't fully understand why ...<br>
> * the [function/mechanism] of [this processes/thing] is not yet known ...
* Great intro to neuroscience

_Rating_: 4.5/5

---

#### _Ultra-learning: Master Hard Skills, Outsmart the Competition, and Accelerate Your Career_
{: #Ultra_Learning}

-- by Scott Young

_Thoughts_
* Packed with practical advice about learning
* The 9 Principles of ultra-learning: meta learning, focus, directness, drill, retrieval, feedback, retention, intuition, experimentation
* Will need to revisit this, makes a lot of sense and is backed up by some compelling data

_Rating_: 5/5

---

#### _Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World_
{: #Deep_Work}

-- by Cal Newport

_Thoughts_
* I resonate with the call for more deep work and less shallow work
* There are a few conflicting and not-so-clear points, get a wee bit wishy washy

_Rating_: 4.5/5
