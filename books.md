I enjoy reading other people's reading lists so I'm writing my own -- hopefully someone finds it interesting. I will rate the books out of 5 and add an asterisk * to books that stood out to me and write some pointers blurb where I can.

> I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me.

_WIP: I'm working on listing all the books I have notes on_

* There are lots of:
> * we don't fully understand why ...<br>
> * the [function/mechanism] of [this processes/thing] is not yet known ...
* Great intro to neuroscience
